Herein it is documented how to access the HydroShare iRODS Users Area with a third-party Windows and Mac application called CyberDuck. CyberDuck is a free open source application that supports many transfer protocols (e.g. FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Azure, Amazon S3, etc.).

There is an opportunity to maximize the value of these research products by practicing good data management and creating descriptive metadata that allows others to easily understand and reuse your research datasets.

      "content": "<h2><b>What?</b></h2>\n<p>HydroShare is a system operated by The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science Inc. (CUAHSI) that enables users to share and publish data and models in a variety of flexible formats, and to make this information available in a citable, shareable and discoverable manner.\u00a0 HydroShare includes a repository for data and models, and tools (web apps) that can act on content in HydroShare providing users with a gateway to high performance computing and computing in the cloud.</p>\n<p>With HydroShare you can: share data and models with colleagues; manage access to shared content; share, access, visualize, and manipulate a broad set of hydrologic data types and models; publish data and models and obtain a citable digital object identifier (DOI); aggregate resources into collections; discover and access data and models published by others; use the web services application programming interface (API) to programmatically access resources; and use integrated web applications to visualize, analyze and run models with data in HydroShare.</p>\n<h2><b>Who?</b></h2>\n<p>HydroShare is freely accessible to everyone, but primarily was designed for water-resources professionals, researchers, educators, and others interested in water-resources data and tools.</p>\n<h2><b>Why?</b></h2>\n<p><span>The goal of HydroShare is to advance hydrologic science by enabling the water-resources community to more easily and freely share products resulting from their research and/or data collection. With Hydroshare, one can Integrate information from multiple sources; re-use data beyond the purpose for which it was originally collected, extending the value of measurement, monitoring and research investments; manage, archive, and publish data in a discoverable manner; increase transparency and support reproducibility of work.</span></p>\n<h2><b>How?</b></h2>\n<p>HydroShare has been, and continues to be, developed through collaborative grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF). \u00a0The primary grants supporting HydroShare development were NSF awards ACI-1148453 and ACI-1148090 (2012-2017). \u00a0Operation is currently through an NSF award to CUAHSI (EAR-1338606) and ongoing development through NSF collaborative awards OAC-1664061, OAC-1664018, and OAC-1664119 (2017-2021). \u00a0The HydroShare development team is led by David Tarboton at Utah State University. \u00a0Refer to the\u00a0<a href=\"https://help.hydroshare.org/about-hydroshare/team/\">team page</a>\u00a0to see a listing of team members and contributors. \u00a0HydroShare is open source, and built on open source software. HydroShare source code is collaboratively developed using repositories in\u00a0<a href=\"https://github.com/hydroshare\">Github</a>\u00a0and primarily uses Python, Django and iRODS technology. We are happy to consider code contributions from anyone but generally ask that coding ability and plans be discussed with us before giving commit access to the GitHub repository. \u00a0Use of the code from GitHub should be done according to the terms of the three clause BSD Open Source license.</p>\n<p>Content that can be shared within HydroShare is diverse, including digital objects that represent multiple hydrologic data types, models and model instances, documents, and other content types commonly used in hydrologic research. These include hydrologic time series, geographic features (vector data), geographic rasters (gridded data), multidimensional space-time data sets (e.g., NetCDF), and composite resources that represent complex datasets such as river geometry. Model Programs and Model Instances are additional types of content that can be shared and manipulated within HydroShare.</p>\n<p>A \u201cresource\u201d is the discrete unit of digital content within HydroShare and is the unit used for management and access control within HydroShare. As such, resources become the social objects around which users collaborate. Resources can be created, modified, versioned, shared, annotated, discovered, and accessed. HydroShare resources have the following properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A resource may consist of a single content file (e.g., in the case of a file containing a single hydrologic time series) or may be an aggregation of multiple content files (e.g., in the case of a hydrologic Model Instance with various input files necessary for model execution).</li>\n<li>A resource containing multiple content files may have a hierarchical file/directory structure.</li>\n<li>A resource may conform to a standardized content data model that is specific to a particular resource type and may define specific file formats, syntax, and/or file hierarchies.</li>\n<li>A resource is described by resource-level metadata designed to include generic information required for all resources and extensions that are specific to each particular resource type.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>"

      "content": "<p><span>The HydroShare architecture is a stack of storage and computation, web services, and user applications. \u00a0A content management system, Django+Mezzanine, provides user interface, search, social media functions, and services. \u00a0iRODS provides content storage. \u00a0A web browser is the main interface to HydroShare, however a web services applications programming interface (API) supports access through other hydrologic modeling systems, and the architecture separates the interface layer and services layer exposing all functionality through these web services. </span></p>\n<p><span>The architecture is organized into three categories: (1) Resource storage, (2) Resource exploration, and (3) actions on resources (Figure 1). \u00a0These are implemented using system components that are relatively loosely coupled and interact through APIs. \u00a0The loose coupling is a variant on Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) that enhances robustness as components can be upgraded and advanced relatively independently. \u00a0It also supports extensibility. \u00a0The Web Applications (Web Apps) approach is configured so that anyone can establish a Web App server that can act on HydroShare resources.</span></p>\n<h5><img alt=\"\" height=\"381\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/Architecture/image00.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"677\"></h5>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 1.\u00a0 HydroShare Architecture</p>\n<p><span>The organization of components parallels the organization of hardware and software on a personal computer. \u00a0iRODS resource servers may be thought of as analogous to different hard disks on a PC, but supporting file storage across the internet and presenting that as a single folder, or collection. \u00a0The HydroShare Django website supports resource exploration, providing discovery and access control, similar to PC explorer or file finder functionality. \u00a0Then apps parallel the software programs on a PC. Here is where there is extensibility. \u00a0Some software is provided by the system, but the full power of this paradigm comes from the system enabling anybody to establish an app server. \u00a0A number of app servers have already been established. \u00a0We have used the Tethys Platform open source software to create an app portal at http://apps.hydroshare.org. The HydroShare team has implemented a number of apps in this portal to support visualization of HydroShare resources and access to third party data such as data from the National Water Model. \u00a0We have also established a Hyrax THREDDS server to enhance access to multidimensional data where we have adopted the netCDF file format from Unidata for resource storage. \u00a0This enables HydroShare to leverage substantial Unidata community software for working with netCDF data. \u00a0Also, with support from a supplement to the CyberGIS SSI project we have developed a collaborative partnership with the University of Illinois CyberGIS center. \u00a0An app to execute hydrologic terrain analysis software at CyberGIS has been configured to act on HydroShare resources and save resources in HydroShare. Lastly, the Purdue members of our team have configured SWATShare, a HUBZero based system for sharing and executing SWAT models to save SWAT model instances in HydroShare. \u00a0SWAT is the Soil Water Assessment Tool, a widely used Hydrologic Model. Apps have been developed to explore, execute and visualize SWAT models in HydroShare through interaction with SWATShare.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p>Please note that HydroShare does not allow creating new SWAT Model Instance resources anymore, and users need to use a Model Instance aggregation to upload \u201cany\u201d models including SWAT. The users are still able to use \u201cOpen with\u201d SWATShare to interact with the obsolete SWAT Model Instance resources. However, \u201cOpen with\u201d SWATShare is still NOT enabled for Model Instance aggregations used for an Instance of SWAT Model, something that will be done in near future.</p>\n<h5></h5>"

For example:</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"230\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/table_1.jpg\" width=\"695\"></p>\n<h2><span>Using fields</span></h2>\n<p><span>The above queries search all resource metadata for the terms listed. For more precise searches, one may also specify the metadata field that contains a desired term. <br></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"364\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/table_2.jpg\" width=\"696\"></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><span>Coverage Type and Availability Field Options:<br></span></h2>\n<p></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"321\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/table_3.jpg\" width=\"696\"></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Availability published implies public, which implies discoverable.</span></li>\n<li><span>Coverage type box implies coverage type point, because the box center is recorded as a point. \u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>To select resources containing time series, use coverage_type:period. </span></li>\n<li><span>Resources containing multiple time series have coverage_type:box even though the data is for specific sites in the box. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>One can also combine various kinds of queries in the search bar by separating them with spaces. For example, the query: </span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>author:Tarboton author:Couch subject:CUAHSI</strong></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>Will return resources for which Tarboton and Couch are both authors, and one subject is CUAHSI. \u00a0For more advanced ways of combining requirements, see the section on query logic below. </span></p>\n<h2><span>Specifying dates</span></h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"174\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/table_4.jpg\" width=\"621\"></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> The Numeric Month/Numeric Day/4 character numeric year format is used.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Date Ranges </span></h2>\n<p><span>The above queries select resources for which a specific date is mentioned. It is often more useful to specify a range of dates: </span></p>\n<p><span><img alt=\"\" height=\"196\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/table_5.jpg\" width=\"698\"></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><span>Date Range Operators<br></span></h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/table_7.jpg\" width=\"694\"></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> Each one of these starts with a colon (:) and that a single : means \u201cequal to\u201d. </span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>Multiple conditions may be separated by spaces on the query line. For example, the search string </span><strong>created&gt;=2/1/2017 created&lt;2/1/2018</strong> <span>selects resources that were created between </span><span>2/1/2017</span><span> and </span><span>1/31/2018</span><span>. </span></p>\n<h2><span>Specifying geographic coordinates</span></h2>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>There are two ways in HydroShare that geographic coordinates are used, both as the coordinates of a point on the earth and as coordinates of a box in which data is recorded. Additionally, the center of each box is recorded as a point.

Learn about content types <a href=\"https://help.hydroshare.org/hydroshare-resources/content-types/\">Here</a>. Some content types can be viewed using Hydroshare Apps.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Can I edit or delete my resource data and/model after it has been made public?</h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>As long as you have not formally published the resource and received a DOI, you can always edit a public resource. You may consider <a href=\"https://help.hydroshare.org/creating-and-managing-resources/creating-resource-versions/\">creating a new resource version</a> if you make significant changes to a resource.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Is there a right or wrong way to add data to HydroShare?</h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>It is important to remember that your resource is only as good as your metadata. There are defintely best practices when it comes to data management and publication in HydroShare, learn more about them <a href=\"https://help.hydroshare.org/publishing-in-hydroshare/metadata-best-practices/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. But in general, err on the side of being more descriptive with your metadata than less.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Filling Out Metadata</h2>\n<h4>Are there metadata requirement examples (or templates) for publishing/storing/and sharing different types of data in HydroShare?</h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Yes, each data type has a set of required metadata. This is documented on help pages for each content type: <a href=\"https://help.hydroshare.org/hydroshare-resources/content-types/\">https://help.hydroshare.org/hydroshare-resources/content-types/\u00a0\u00a0</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How do I set spatial (geographic) coverage on a resource?</h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>There are a few ways to do this. The first way to set geographic coverage is to put your resource in \u201cedit\u201d mode, scroll down, and drop a pin or define a bounding box on the map. You can also specify latitude and longitude coordinates and the pin will be added to the map based on the entered coordinates.\u00a0</li>\n<li>If your resource contains files that each relate to different geographic regions, select \u201cedit\u201d on your resource, and right click a file in the content section to add metadata. Once all content level spatial metadata has been set, you will be able to scroll back up and select \u201cset spatial coverage from content files\u201d. The resulting resource level spatial coverage will encompass all content level spatial coverage.

Both HydroShare and HIS are administered and maintained by CUAHSI, but HIS is a system specifically for time series data. HIS follows a strict upload template that adheres to ODM 1.1\u00a0</span><span>data formatting standards. Once data are uploaded through HydroServer, they are disoverable through HydroClient. Both HydroShare and HIS offer DOIs for data and make data discoverable.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How does HydroShare archive data?</h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The data is held in a data center at RENCI at UNC Chapel Hill. In addition to the active storage there is failover redundant storage in an offsite location for data recovery.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How long does HydroShare archive data?</h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>CUAHSI is committed to maintaining availability of published data indefinitely. CUAHSI data services are a National Science Foundation facility, so while still subject to 5-year funding cycles, there is an implied commitment for funding to be ongoing to maintain the data.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>When does HydroShare maintenance occur?</h4>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Most website maintenance occurs on Tuesday mornings every four weeks. There is little to no downtime associated with updates.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>"

      "content": "<h2><span>What are web apps?</span></h2>\n<p><span>Apps are the software tools that allow you to visualize, analyze, and work with resources (data and models) in HydroShare. \u00a0Apps are hosted on separate web servers from the HydroShare website (</span><a href=\"http://www.hydroshare.org\"><span>www.hydroshare.org</span></a><span>) and access HydroShare resources using web services via the REST applications programmers interface (API). This is a loose coupling that makes HydroShare extensible. \u00a0Just as anyone can write a program for a desktop computer, anyone can set up a server to support an app. \u00a0The HydroShare team, and others in the CUAHSI community have set up several apps that provide visualization and analysis capability for HydroShare resources, with more to come. \u00a0A number of apps originated from the </span><a href=\"https://www.cuahsi.org/summerinstitute\"><span>National Water Center Summer Institute</span></a><span> that CUAHSI organizes and these enhance access to data from the </span><a href=\"http://water.noaa.gov/about/nwm\"><span>NOAA National Water Model</span></a><span>. \u00a0Apps approved by the HydroShare development team are accessible from apps.hydroshare.org the page accessed by clicking the \"Apps\" link in the main navigation bar at the top of the HydroShare web page. </span></p>\n<h2><span>How can I find and use Apps in HydroShare</span></h2>\n<p><span>Click on </span><span>the \"Apps\" link in the main navigation bar at the top of the HydroShare web page</span><span>. \u00a0This will take you to apps.hydroshare.org that holds apps approved by the HydroShare development team. \u00a0You need to have a HydroShare account to access Apps, because they are set up to save results that you want stored back to HydroShare in your account. \u00a0Click on each App icon to open it and learn about it or explore the descriptions of Apps in these pages. \u00a0You can also in the Discover page find and filter on App instances to locate any Apps that any users have made available to you in HydroShare.</span></p>\n<h2><span>What is the web app resource type?</span></h2>\n<p><span>The web app resource type is used to match an App (on a separate server) with the types of resources (and files in resources) it can act on. \u00a0The metadata for an app instance describes the app and to sets the permissions (who is given access to the app) and the types of resources it can act on. \u00a0For users with access to an app, when they are on a resource of the type the app can open, it appears in the Open with button and web apps tab of the resource. \u00a0Clicking these launches the app on its separate website, and after authorization accesses the resource files with the app, resulting in the app performing its actions on the resource. </span></p>\n<h2><span>How can I develop web apps? </span></h2>\n<p><span>If you are a web developer you can use any web server to set up an app by programming it to interact with HydroShare resources using the REST API. \u00a0The majority of HydroShare apps have been developed using the Tethys platform, but there are apps hosted at NCSA developed using CyberGIS and Jupyter Notebook technology and the SWATShare Apps hosted at Purdue are developed using PHP. \u00a0Tethys is a Python/Django based web development platform that can be used to develop and host water resources web applications or web apps. It includes a suite of free and open source software (FOSS) that has been carefully selected to address the unique development needs of water resources web apps. Tethys web apps are developed using a Python software development kit (SDK) which includes programmatic links to each software component. Tethys Platform is powered by the Django Python web framework giving it a solid web foundation with excellent security and performance. \u00a0</span><span>Learn more at: </span><a href=\"http://www.tethysplatform.org/\"><span>http://www.tethysplatform.org/</span></a></p>"

Hydrological observations and land surface model outputs are retrieved, visualized with maps and plots of time series (data rods), and the data and graphic images can be exported in various common data formats.

Users can locate the nearest NHD flowline of a interest point and delineate associated watershed, upstream, and downstream.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What can I do with this App?</h2>\n<p>Users can identify specific locations or particular watershed outlets within the continental United States as points of interest. After points of interest have been identified, the EPA WATERS Web Service app comes with five analyses to delineate any of the following hydrologic variables: 1) watershed, 2) upstream mainstem, 3) upstream with tributaries, 4) downstream mainstream, or 5) downstream with divergences. Users can choose to export the results as KML files in Google Earth viewable format, or upload their data as new resources in Hydroshare.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>App Output</h2>\n<p>Upon selecting the stream or location of interest, the app will identify the 1) Feature Name, 2) Reach Code, 3) Measure (percentage from the navigating point to the top of the flowline), and 4) HUC 12 code. The analysis would then produce the value for the variable of interest. Finally, users can download the output in the KML file format or upload the KML file to HydroShare as a new generic resource with the city of interest and the hydrologic variable as the associated metadata.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Examples Uses of the App</h2>\n<p>Use case of delineating Provo River Watershed and upstream</p>\n<p>Step 1: Access EPA WATERS Services Web App, a popup window will show instructions of the app. <a href=\"https://apps.hydroshare.org/apps/watershed-delin/\">https://apps.hydroshare.org/apps/watershed-delin/</a></p>\n<p>Step 2: Fine Provo River and click it on the map or use search box on the left. Provo River will show up in blue color. The app will also return basic hydrology information about the selected NHD flowline, including feature name, reach code, measure, and HUC 12 code.</p>\n<p>Step 3: Select \u201cDelineate watershed \u201d from the \"Select EPA WATERS Service\" drop down list to run. The delineated watershed will be shown on map. The app also return basic information about the watershed, including watershed area and stream segments.</p>\n<p>Step 4: Select \u201cUpstream with tributaries \u201d from the \"Select EPA WATERS Service\" drop down list to run. The delineated upstream will be shown on map and the number of stream segments will be shown on the left.</p>\n<p>Step 5: You can click the \"Download Results\" to save results as KML files that can be viewed in Google Earth or other KML enabled applications. You can also click the \"Upload to HydroShare\" to upload the results to HydroShare and creates a permanent HydroShare resource that can be directly retrieved and used later without having to re-run this app. The metadata is required and will be automatically filled out by the app, you can also modify them as you want.</p>\n<p>After clicking the \u201cProceed\u201d button, the uploading status will show up in the left bottom. A link to the landing page of the newly created HydroShare resource will be shown once the files are successfully uploaded.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Suggestions to learn more</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/waters-web-services\">https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/waters-web-services</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/nhdplus-national-hydrography-dataset-plus\">https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/nhdplus-national-hydrography-dataset-plus</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/danames/tethys_watershed_delin\">https://github.com/danames/tethys_watershed_delin</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/07ea66da210043ce93d8e29769c1776f/\">https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/07ea66da210043ce93d8e29769c1776f/</a><i> (Sample output in HydroShare) </i></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Credits, Authors, Contributors and Contacts</h2>\n<p>BYU</p>\n<p>Tethys</p>\n<p>Funding</p>\n<p>Dan Ames</p>\n<p>Xiaohui Qiao</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>Note: This app uses the United States EPA WATERS Web and Database Services and only works for watersheds and drainages in the continental United States and Hawaii. </span></p>"

Users can generate new visual layers by uploading geospatial data files or importing data from HydroShare resources. Map layer visualization state can be saved back to HydroShare as a map project file stored in a Generic resource.</span></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h2><span>What can I do with this App?</span></h2>\n<p><span>With this app, you can visualize any spatial data that you have access to in HydroShare (if it is o the following resource types: Geographic Feature, Raster, Generic) on a map. You can also upload spatial files directly into the app, each of which will both be stored in newly-created, appropriate resource and then displayed on the app\u2019s map for visualization. Multiple spatially-based files and/or resources can be added and viewed together, where each separate map layer (spatial file or resource) has its own layer list item from which it\u2019s viewing options can be manipulated. Viewing options include the ability to modify the symbology (color scheme, labels, etc), toggle the visibility, and render on top of or beneath other layers.</span></p>\n<p><span>This app will also save its current state in a map project file that is stored in a newly-created Generic HydroShare resource. Thus, all current layers and their configurations (symbology, visibility, rendering order, display names) can be accessed again at a later time or shared with others.</span></p>\n<p><span>Users can choose from three internal base maps of the Earth (e.g., Aerial view, Aerial with names, or Roadview). Additional data uploaded or imported into the session would generate new data layers for visualization. Users can manipulate the visual attributes, modify the legend, or rename each layer using the layers options menu (on the right-corner of each layer tab). Finally, users can choose to save their session as a new HydroShare generic resource or export their visualizations as PDF or PNG file formats.</span></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h2><span>Example Uses of the App</span></h2>\n<p><span>HydroShare GIS can either be opened directly from the HydroShare Apps Library Portal (</span><a href=\"https://apps.hydroshare.org/apps\"><span>https://apps.hydroshare.org/apps</span></a><span>), or from the \u201cOpen with...\u201d dropdown on the landing page of associated HydroShare resources (Geographic Feature, Raster, Generic).</span></p>\n<p><span>An example use of opening the app directly might be that a HydroShare user just finished producing/obtaining various spatial data files and wants to both upload them to HydroShare and then visualize them together with other existing HydroShare resource.

To improve interoperability and accessibility the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) defined standards for\u00a0 web services (OWS) that allow geospatial functionality across multiple platforms. They include services for data access, data display and data processing. The three most widely known OWS are Web Mapping Services (WMS), Web Feature Services (WFS), and Web Coverage Services (WCS).</span></p>\n<p><span>HydroShare provides a service that publishes geographic raster and feature\u00a0resources\u00a0 as OGC compliant webservices.

Below are three example use cases of how to use the THREDDS app and OPeNDAP client software for data subset, visualization and analysis.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3><b>Use case 1: Creating a new subset NetCDF file with the DAP2 protocol</b></h3>\n<p><span>A common use case is when a HydroShare user wants to get a subset of the original dataset as a new NetCDF file. NetCDF files may contain a lot of data. Rather than transfer entire NetCDF datasets over the Internet, a Hydroshare user may more quickly obtain a subset of variables from the dataset constrained by (usually geo-temporal) dimensions. Here is an example workflow for the this user case:</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<ol>\n<ul>\n<li><span>In a browser, navigate to the landing page of a Hydroshare resource containing one or more NetCDF files. The resource should be a Composite resource type shared as \u201cPublic\u201d or \u201cPublished\u201d. </span><a href=\"https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/f3f947be65ca4b258e88b600141b85f3/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Here</span></a><span> is an example resource.</span></li>\n<li><span>From the resource landing page, click on the \"Open With\" button. A menu appears with the apps authorized to access the resource. Select the THREDDS app. This will open a new browser tab displaying the Hydroshare THREDDS server (</span><a href=\"https://thredds.hydroshare.org\" target=\"_blank\"><span>https://thredds.hydroshare.org</span></a><span>) navigated to the contents of the resource.</span></li>\n<li><span>Navigate through the resource contents to the NetCDF file of interest and click on the link for the NetCDF file. This will display the list of available THREDDS services for the file.</span></li>\n<li><span>Click on the \"OPeNDAP\" service which allows access to the NetCDF dataset via various </span><a href=\"https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/tds/current/tutorial/DAP.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>DAP2</span></a><span> protocol responses. An OPeNDAP dataset access form is displayed (see Figure 1). This form constructs subset URLS for use with OPeNDAP client software. This example uses the popular </span><a href=\"http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/io.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>xarray</span></a><span> Python package based on the </span><a href=\"https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Python NetCDF</span></a><span> wrapper for the </span><a href=\"https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>NetCDF C</span></a><span> library.</span><img alt=\"OpenDAP Dataset Access Form. Form contains the following text entry fields: Action, Data URL, Global Attributes, variables, \" height=\"1065\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/Opendap/opendap_(11).png\" width=\"946\"><b></b></li>\n</ul>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 1: OPeNDAP dataset access form</b><b><br></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>On the form, select check-boxes for the variables to be subsetted. Be sure to include all dimensional variables required by dependent variables. In this example, </span><span>time</span><span>, </span><span>x</span><span>, and </span><span>y</span><span> are dimensional variables required by the </span><span>SWE</span><span> (snow water equivalent) dependent variable. Dimensions are distinguished on the form by the inclusion of the index extents.</span></li>\n<li><span>On the form, constrain the selected variables as desired. Constraints for dimensions are automatically filled to cover all the index values for the dimension.</span></li>\n<li><span>Dimensioned variables must be constrained by dimensional extents. Dimensional constraints are specified with slice notation. Indices are zero-based and inclusive.</span>\n<ul>\n<li><span>[start-index:stride:last-index]</span></li>\n<li><span>[start-index:last-index]</span><span> (stride assumed to be 1)</span></li>\n<li><span>[index]</span><span> (for a single value of the dimension)\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>In this example, the </span><span>SWE</span><span> variable is constrained to include all </span><span>x</span><span> and </span><span>y</span><span> values but only for the first </span><span>time</span><span> value.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span>Dimensionless variables may be constrained by value. Some dimensionless variables only exist for their variable attributes. In this example, the projection information for the grid mapping of the </span><span>SWE</span><span> (snow water equivalent) variable is contained in the attributes of the </span><span>transverse_mercator</span><span> variable. The only value for the </span><span>transverse_mercator</span><span> variable is an empty string.</span></li>\n<li><span>As variables are selected and constrained, the form adds parameters to the \"Data URL\" field at the top of the form. When all selections and constraints are made, copy the URL for pasting into OPeNDAP client software.</span></li>\n<li><span>Use OPeNDAP client software with the copied URL to remotely read the selected and constrained data, and then save the data to a local NetCDF file (see Figure 2). When the data are read via DAP2, the global attributes of the dataset are included. The global attributes, such as the </span><span>history</span><span> global attribute which provides the provenance of the dataset, may be edited to reflect the subset constraints before writing the new NetCDF dataset file if desired. </span><span><br><br></span></li>\n</ul>\n<pre><span>$ python</span><span><br></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; import xarray as x</span><span><br></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; ds = x.open_dataset(\"http://thredds.hydroshare.org/thredds/dodsC/hydroshare/resources/f3f947be65ca4b258e88b600141b85f3/data/contents/SWE_time.nc?time[0:1:2183],y[0:1:58],x[0:1:38],transverse_mercator,SWE[0:1:0][0:1:58][0:1:38]\")</span><span><br></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; ds.to_netcdf(\"swe-t0.nc\")</span><span><br></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; exit()</span><span><br></span><span>$</span></pre>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Figure 2: Writing a subsetted NetCDF dataset file with xarray</b></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b></b></p>\n<h3><b>Use case 2: Resource visualization with Panoply</b></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Panoply</span></a><span> is an OPeNDAP client software for data visualization.

TDS provides web services which publish remote access to data and metadata stored in a variety of well-known geo-temporal dataset formats used for environmental research such as GRIB (Gridded Binary), HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format version 5), and most commonly NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) as viewed through a Common Data Model (CDM). TDS presents gridded, point, and time series datasets organized into thematic catalogs. TDS provides access to data through suites of web services such as OPeNDAP and OGC.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>OPeNDAP</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>The Open-source Project for Network Data Access Protocols (OPeNDAP) specifies two suites of web service requests and responses, DAP2 and DAP4, for remotely accessing CDM datasets. Remote access of TDS-hosted datasets through DAP2 client software allows the advantage of placing dimensional constraints on the CDM variable arrays transported in a response. The DAP2 request contains the constraints and effectively creates a subset of the TDS-hosted dataset for transport. The requesting client therefore need not concern itself with the size of the TDS-hosted dataset, but only with the size of the data response.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>DAP2</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>As an additional advantage, DAP2 clients, such as Unidata\u2019s NetCDF libraries or higher-level software utilizing those libraries such as xarray, initially make requests for only the metadata contained in the CDM header via a DAP2 Data Descriptor Structure (DDS) request and do not further request data until the variable array data is instantiated in the client via a DAP2 Distributed Oceanographic Data Systems (DODS) request. This \u201clazy-loading\u201d behavior allows remotely opening the entire dataset but only transports portions of the dataset as needed programmatically thereby reducing network load, transmission time, and memory consumption.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>CDM, NetCDF, and NCML</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>In contrast, due to dimensional constraints in DAP2 requests and DAP2 client lazy-loading, tools which assemble and manage Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) datasets have more influence on the size of TDS-hosted datasets. When only subsets of the datasets require transport, practicalities concerning dataset construction and server-side dataset management become the principles determining how to best partition large collections of data. Often the tools and computer stations which remotely access CDM datasets through TDS are the same or similar tools and stations constructing and managing the datasets prior to hosting. When collection-wide views of data are desirable, TDS supports NetCDF Markup Language (NCML) facilities to aggregate many datasets into one virtual dataset.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>NetCDF and CF Conventions</span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>CDM is a general model for dataset, dimensional, and variable attribute instantiation. Many TDS services depend on the recognition of dataset feature types (i.e., point, trajectory, station, profile, radial, grid, swath, etc.) for optimal operation. NetCDF which configures metadata in compliance with Climate Forecast (CF) conventions also enables many both TDS and DAP2 clients to intelligently recognize feature types beyond what the general model would otherwise convey, particularly for geo-referencing and projection.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>References</span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>TDS:</span><a href=\"https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/tds/5.0/userguide/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <span>https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/tds/5.0/userguide/index.html</span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>Common Data Model (CDM):</span><a href=\"https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/v4.6/CDM/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <span>https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/v4.6/CDM/index.html</span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>OPeNDAP requests and responses:</span><a href=\"https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/tds/current/tutorial/DAP.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <span>https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/tds/current/tutorial/DAP.html</span></a><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>DAP2 Specification:</span><a href=\"https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esdis/eso/standards-and-references/data-access-protocol-2\" target=\"_blank\"> <span>https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esdis/eso/standards-and-references/data-access-protocol-2</span></a><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>NetCDF format specifications:</span><a href=\"https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/documentation/historic/netcdf/File-Format.html\" target=\"_blank\"> <span>https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/documentation/historic/netcdf/File-Format.html</span></a><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>Climate Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions:</span><a href=\"https://cfconventions.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> <span>https://cfconventions.org/</span></a><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span>Domenico, Ben &amp; Caron, John &amp; Davis, Ethan &amp; Kambic, Robb &amp; Nativi, Stefano.

The web app will only be able to operate on resources that match the </span><span>selected sharing statuses.</span></li>\n<li><b>Supported file extensions</b><span>: The connector can appear on the right click menu for individual files in a resource for specified file extensions. NOTE: If this is set, the App-Launching File Level URL pattern needs to be provided to set the parameters to be passed when selected by right clicking.</span></li>\n<li><b>App Home Page URL</b><span>: This URL will be launched from the \u201cOpen\u201d button on the web app resource landing page.</span></li>\n<li><b>App-Launching Pattern URL</b><span>: This URL will be launched from the \u201cOpen With\u201d button on supported resource types with the designated sharing status. Parameters are set to control the passing of specific resource or user information to the web app associated with the URL. Parameters are designed so users can configure flexible URLs to launch apps that have different expectations (e.g., ${HS_RES_ID} to pass resource ID, ${HS_FILE_NAME} to pass file name).

This requested data push operation via iRODS will only happen right before the external web app is launched so the requested data is ready to be consumed by the web app. To become federated with the HydroShare production system, the external web app institution is required to sign a federation agreement to take full responsibility of keeping its iRODS server operational and well-maintained. To indicate that HydroShare should perform the requested data push operation when launching a web app, add the following three Additional Metadata key-value pairs in the web app connector resource:</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span>Name\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </span> <span>Value</span></p>\n<p><span>------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>\n<p><b>irods_federation_target_path </b><span>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0target logical path in the federated iRODS server to which to push requested data in HydroShare</span></p>\n<p><b>irods_federation_target_resource \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </b><span>target iRODS resource in the federated iRODS server to which to push requested data in HydroShare</span></p>\n<p><b>require_user_authentication\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </b><span>true if the web app requires user authentication and false otherwise.

It aims to fully describe the software-related metadata of a given model program to enable scientists to seamlessly retrieve all the content and information required to get a model up-and-running on their local or server-side machine. This aggregation consists of uploaded content such as source code, compiled binaries, and documentation, as well as metadata describing the model's software. The model program aggregation can be related to many model instance aggregations to completely describe a simulation and the exact software version used for a particular study to make data replication possible. Aggregation-level metadata describes this aggregation type.</span></p>\n<p><br><span>When a composite resource containing a model program aggregation is downloaded as a Zipped BagIt Archive, the user finds that in the &lt;ResourceID&gt;/data/contents directory, in addition to the contents of model program aggregation, two additional files are also included, which hold the content type metadata (&lt;AggregationName&gt;_meta.xml and &lt;AggregationName&gt;_resmap.xml), where &lt;AggregationName&gt; is the name of the model program aggregation. If the model program aggregation from</span><span> a single file or a folder containing one or more files.</span><span> has a JSON schema, the same JSON schema would be also downloaded as &lt;AggregationName&gt;_schema.json.</span><br><br></p>\n<h2><span>Example</span></h2>\n<p><span>Model program aggregation can be created from a single file or a folder containing one or more files. The process for both file-based and folder-based model program aggregation is similar. Therefore, only the creation of a folder-based model program aggregation is described below. Please note that to create a file-based model program aggregation, the file added to a resource to become a model program aggregation should not create aggregation upon upload (e.g., do not use a NetCDF file creating a Multidimensional aggregation upon upload).\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<p><b>Folder-based model program aggregation:</b></p>\n<p><span>One related file was added to a resource and placed in a folder called \u201cSWAT Model Program\u201d</span></p>\n<p><br><img alt='A file with an alphanumeric title in the contents section, within a folder called \"Swat model Program\".

Content specific metadata can then be added in the panel on the right side of the file browser interface.

This standard set of metadata includes general information (Title, Keywords, Coverage information, and\u00a0Additional metadata (key/value)) as well as model program specific metadata (Name, Version, Release Date, Website, Code Repository, Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Content File Types). In addition, a metadata schema in JSON format can be used in a model program to define the metadata requirements of a corresponding model instance aggregation. When a model instance aggregation is linked to a model program aggregation using the 'executed_by' metadata field of the model instance, the metadata requirements of the model instance will be driven by the metadata schema of the linked model program. Both a standard set of metadata fields and the schema-based metadata fields in model instance aggregation can be used to represent a specific model instance (e.g., SWAT).</span><br><img alt=\"Contents section with the same file as above, with the metadata field open showing the keywords entry field, the extended metadata entry field with the add keywords button, and a general information entry field with 5 subsections: name, version, release date, website, code repository, and operating system.  \" height=\"421\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/model_program_3.jpg\" width=\"615\"><br><span>In the metadata field \u201cModel Instance Metadata Schema\u201d, the user can either select a JSON schema provided by HydroShare (currently only two schemas are provided: SWAT_Schema_1.0.0.json and MODFLOW_Schema_1.0.0.json) or upload a JSON file that has the metadata schema for the model instance aggregation which can be linked to this model program (linking a model instance to a model program is described </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YvqTVC0Qf5M3rPLNCstB7RRJekT0vUF55I70c_NfrH4/edit#\"><span>here</span></a><span>).

Switch from edit mode to preview mode by clicking the arrow</b><b>\u00a0icon.</b></p>\n<h3><span>Required Fields\u00a0</span></h3>\n<p><span>To ensure the resource is interpretable and can be made public, the required fields </span><b>(title, abstract, keywords)</b><span> must be completed, and the resource must contain </span><b>files</b><span>. Examples of these fields are given below.</span></p>\n<p><b>Title: </b><span>The title should describe the content of the resource. Consider including the data type, location of collection, and date range of collection.</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><i><span>Example: Grab Sample Data for the Northwest Field Canal in Logan, UT, USA</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Abstract: </b><span>Use the abstract to put the content in context, including the rationale for the data collection or modeling. It should generally describe the methods of data creation - i.e., what you did, why you did it, how you did it, when and where you did it. The Abstract can also include a description of the resource content and organization to help a potential user navigate the various files.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><i><span>Example: This resource includes water quality samples collected within the Northwest Field Canal, located in Logan, UT and from stormwater outfalls that drain to the canal. These data were collected to with the purpose of developing surrogate relationships between in situ parameters and total suspended solids (TSS) and to determine spatial loading patterns in the drainage. Samples were collected manually and via an ISCO 3700 automated sampler. These samples were then analyzed for TSS), total phosphorus (TP), and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). Methods implemented for sample collection and analysis are described within the resource.</span></i></p>\n<p><b>Keywords: </b><span>Select keywords that are descriptive and thorough to facilitate discovery of your data. Add keywords for the category of the data, variables included in the dataset, methods for data generation, and the associated geographic area. Unique acronym-like keywords may also be used similar to hashtags in some social media. For example, \u201ciUTAH\u201d as a keyword facilitates discover\u00a0</span>of resources associated with the iUTAH project.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><i><span>Example: Northwest Field Canal,\u00a0 Suspended Solids, Utah Logan, Water Quality,\u00a0 Urban Stormwater, Phosphorus</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span></span></i></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Screencapture from hydroshare.org or the top section of a resource landing page containing the example title, abstract, and keywords from above.  \" height=\"431\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/grabsample.png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"655\"></p>\n<p><i><span></span></i></p>\n<h3>Files</h3>\n<p><span>Use descriptive and meaningful file names.

Historically there have been challenges associated with linking geospatially related data. This feature will increase machine readable linkages between related resources, ease data discovery, and increase the robustness of metadata for resources with geographic coverage.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>The Related Geospatial Features section of the resource landing page allows users to create relationships within their resources between their datasets and other hydrologically related features. These features will appear in a convenient map view on the resource landing page, and selecting any of the related features will redirect users to the geoconnex reference page in a new tab. Feature information is also added into the resource metadata and relationships are accessible to search engine web-crawlers.</span></p>\n<p><span>The feature operates using the user defined spatial coverage of the resource, and allows users to search for related features within the following libraries of features:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>2 Digit Hydrologic Regions</span></li>\n<li><span>4 Digit Hydrologic Subregions</span></li>\n<li><span>6 Digit Hydrologic Basins\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>8 Digit Hydrologic Subbasins</span></li>\n<li><span>10 Digit Hydrologic Watersheds</span></li>\n<li><span>National Aquifers of the United States from USGS National Water Information System National Aquifer Code List</span></li>\n<li><span>Principal Aquifers of the United States from 2003 USGS data release (principal_aq)</span></li>\n<li><span>Secondary Hydrogeologic Regions of the Coterminous United States from 2018 USGS data Release</span></li>\n<li><span>US Reference Stream Gage Monitoring Locations</span></li>\n<li><span>US reference Mainstream Rivers (Mainstreams)</span></li>\n<li><span>US States</span></li>\n<li><span>Native American Lands</span></li>\n<li><span>US Metropolitan and Micropolitan Areas (cbsa)</span></li>\n<li><span>Urbanized Areas and Urban Clusters (2010 Census) (ua10)</span></li>\n<li><span>US legally incorporated and census designated places (places)</span></li>\n<li><span>US reference Dams (dams)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to Add Related Features:<span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<p><b>Step 1: Select a collection to search.\u00a0</b></p>\n<p><span>Once the collection to be searched has been selected, the map on the right will populate with all of the features that intersect your geographic coverage. We recommend adding spatial coverage to your resource before attempting to find related geospatial features. If your resource does not have spatial coverage, the Related Geospatial Features search will attempt to display ALL features in the collection. Because this query can map up to 5,000 features, this can be a slow process</span></p>\n<p><span>A connection can also be added by providing a link that resolves in a feature not yet in the geoconnex database. This link will automatically hyperlink once added.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Step 2: Select related features to add to resource metadata</b></p>\n<p><span>The features that populated in the map on the right will also populate in list form in the box labeled \u201cSelect related features to add to resource metadata\u201d. Users can select any number of items from this list, search for features by typing, or select features directly on the map.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>Once selected, users can exit editing mode on the resource, and scroll down to the Related Geospatial Features section to view the selected features on the map and in list form.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<h3><b>Map Controls:</b></h3>\n<p><span>On the map there are four selectable icons.

Once a set of resources is selected, the buttons at the top of the tabular view of resources can be used to label, favorite, or delete the selected resources.</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"3 icons, a blue tag, a yellow star, and a red trashcan. \" height=\"68\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/myresources3.png\" width=\"162\"></p>"

Doing so permits the resource to be cited in the paper, verified and examined by reviewers, and edited based on reviewer comments. When the paper is accepted for publication, the resource can then be permanently published with a citable Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Below are steps to accomplish this. Order may change slightly based on the journal.\u00a0</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Create the resource in HydroShare, upload content files, and ensure that metadata are complete.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>Make the resource public.</span></li>\n<li><span>Cite the HydroShare resource in the references section of the paper using the HydroShare URL. This ensures that reviewers can access the resource.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>Submit the paper for review.</span></li>\n<li><span>Based on reviewer suggestions and paper revisions, make any changes that are necessary to the HydroShare resource.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>When the paper is accepted, in the final text submitted for typesetting, cite the HydroShare resource using its DOI reference. Use the prefix \u201c</span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4311/hs\"><span>https://doi.org/10.4211/hs</span></a><span>\u201d followed by the resource\u2019s unique identifier, which is indicated on the resource landing page \u201cHow to cite\u201d section.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>When the publisher issues a DOI for the paper, add the full reference for the paper to the related resources metadata on the HydroShare resource. This ensures that the HydroShare resource has a link that points at the final paper.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>Then, finalize and permanently publish the HydroShare resource.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>If you follow this process, you will have a citation to the paper in your HydroShare resource that uses a DOI and a citation to the HydroShare resource in the paper that also uses a DOI.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"

All file types are supported.</p>\n<h3><span>What is a Resource?</span></h3>\n<p><b>All data and models uploaded to HydroShare become part of a \u201cresource\u201d. </b><span>HydroShare uses the term \u201cresource\u201d to describe the data, models and their associated metadata as one single unit of digital content\u00ad. Other websites may use the terms, \u201cpackage\u201d, \u201citem\u201d, \u201cdata\u201d as synonymous to resource. A resource provides the ability to group together multiple files of different types in one location. Read about this </span><a href=\"https://help.hydroshare.org/hydroshare-resources/content-types/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>here.</span></a></p>\n<h3><span>Organize the data and models before uploading</span></h3>\n<p><span>Before uploading data and models to HydroShare, it is important to organize them effectively. Most efforts generate multiple files with complexity that requires forethought toward organization. Consider how potential end-users will want to interact with the content and what structure will best facilitate access, interpretation, and reuse. For instance, for a single research effort with 50 different data files that are the same format, you may want to separate these data files based on types of data that were collected/analyzed and/or parse the data by date ranges. See the </span><a href=\"https://pages.hydroshare.orghttps://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/hydroshare_guide_for_data_authors_and_publishers.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Guide for Data Authors and Publishers</span></a><span> for more guidance.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3>Symbology in HydroShare</h3>\n<p><span>Below is a legend containing some of the essential symbols you will see as you navigate HydroShare.</span></p>\n<p><b>Content Types</b><span> are discussed in greater detail </span><a href=\"https://help.hydroshare.org/hydroshare-resources/content-types/\"><span>Here</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span><img alt=\"Screencapture of the site icon legend from hydroshare.org.

      "content": "<p><span>HydroShare modeling functionality has been developed to support collaborative modeling needs of the hydrologic community.\u00a0 Hydrologic modeling is often collaborative and teamwork is required to develop models and conduct research involving hydrologic models.\u00a0 The goal of HydroShare modeling functionality is to advance hydrologic science by enabling the scientific community to more easily and freely share products resulting from their research - not just the scientific publication summarizing a study, but also the data and models used to create the scientific publication.</span></p>\n<p><span>Modeling functionality includes</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/hydroshare-resources/content-types/model-program/\"><span>Model program</span></a><span> aggregations</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"/hydroshare-resources/content-types/model-program/\"><span>Model instance</span></a><span> aggregations</span></li>\n<li><span>Apps that execute models and perform analyses</span></li>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/modeling/swatshare/\"><span>SWATShare</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<li><a href=\"/modeling/jupyter-python-notebook/\"><span>Jupyter Python Notebook code execution</span></a><span>\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>A model program aggregation is designed to encapsulate all the software and files necessary to identify, install and run a given hydrologic model.\u00a0 By saving, sharing, and referring to the specific version of the model program used in your work, you can enhance the reproducibility of results produced with a model and encourage its use by others.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>A model instance aggregation holds the input files required for application of a hydrologic model to a specific location. A model instance aggregation may optionally include the output files resulting from model execution. One (to many) model instance aggregations can be executed by a model program aggregation and be linked to it. The design for metadata associated with a model instance was intended to capture the aspects required to define and distinguish between different model instances across the wide variety of hydrologic models. This design, therefore, provides two ways to capture metadata for a model instance. First, it includes model instance generic metadata elements which are applicable to any model program.\u00a0 Second, HydroShare users can extend the design by leveraging the enhanced functionality of the model instance metadata schema according to their needs; the reason to consider such a functionality was that the wide variety of hydrologic models require different metadata to describe them, and there is no consensus on any given set of metadata that can describe a specific model program.\u00a0 A model instance metadata schema is a user-definable and machine-readable schema that extends metadata elements by generating specific Additional Metadata fields to describe the model instance. Utilizing the model instance metadata schema, the user can define the Additional Metadata fields\u2019 semantics (i.e., properties such as title and description of the field), and rules for the Additional Metadata fields content (i.e., properties such as data type and default value, and whether the field is mandatory or optional, whether the field has nested fields inside it, whether the field must be chosen from a set of controlled values, whether it is a multiple checkbox field). In this design, we chose the JSON format for model instance metadata schema due to several reasons including being widely accepted in any computer science field, machine-readable, and readily understood by humans specially who are not programming experts. Users can either use the example JSON schema provided by HydroShare for SWAT and MODFLOW or upload their own JSON schema in HydroShare. The example metadata schema provided by HydroShare can either be used for SWAT and MODFLOW model programs with no further changes, or followed as\u00a0 an example to create a user version of SWAT and MODFLOW JSON schema or create a JSON schema for any other hydrologic models as per users\u2019 needs. To create their own JSON schema, users need to follow the guidelines mentioned in </span><a href=\"/modeling/model-instance-metadata-schema/\"><span>Model Instance Metadata Schema</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<h2><span>How can I publish my model in HydroShare?</span></h2>\n<p><span>Refer to the GitHub wiki </span><a href=\"https://github.com/hydroshare/hydroshare/wiki/Publishing-Model-Instances-Using-HydroShare\"><span>guide to publishing model instances in HydroShare</span></a><span> (Please note that this guide is for the obsolete model instance resources. The guide for the model instance aggregation is still under development and once it is ready it will replace the old GitHub wiki guide). </span></p>\n<h2><span>How can I execute a model in HydroShare?</span></h2>\n<p><span>Model execution in HydroShare is intended to help users execute models.\u00a0 Most hydrologic modeling is done either on the user\u2019s personal computer or through access to a centralized computing system.\u00a0 This may be hampered by a user\u2019s knowledge of centralized computing systems, especially high-performance computing systems, the capacity of a local computer, the compatibility and dependency requirements for installation on a local computer, and the time taken to get a local model installation properly configured and validated.\u00a0 HydroShare is working to provide server, or cloud-based model execution capability.\u00a0 Here \u201ccloud\u201d means execution on any server that is remote from the user and the user does not need to be too concerned where it is to use it.\u00a0 This is part of the general trend towards use of software services instead of local computing.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>To support more flexible model execution and data analysis, HydroShare supports Jupyter Notebook functionality as an app that may be launched from HydroShare, access the contents of HydroShare resources and save results back in HydroShare resources. A </span><a href=\"http://jupyter.org/\"><span>Jupyter notebook</span></a><span> is a web application that contains live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. Code in a Jupyter notebook may execute any operating system or language specific (HydroShare uses Python) commands within the hosting environment providing users with access to the computational capability of the hosting environment without requiring software installation or configuration.\u00a0 This does not relieve the user from needing to learn the language involved (e.g. Python) or commands associated with the program being used (e.g. RHESSys, Landlab), but it does alleviate the need for users to install and have the capacity to run these programs locally. HydroShare\u2019s Jupyter notebook installation includes the following functionality:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pages.hydroshare.org/modeling/rhessys/\"><span>RHESSys Modeling</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pages.hydroshare.org/modeling/landlab/\"><span>LandLab Modeling</span></a></li>\n</ul>"

      "content": "<p><span>The Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys) Workflows provides a series of Python tools for performing</span><a href=\"http://fiesta.bren.ucsb.edu/%7Erhessys/\"> <span>RHESSys</span></a><span> data preparation workflows. \u00a0RHESSys is a GIS-based, hydro-ecological modelling framework designed to simulate carbon, water, and nutrient fluxes. By combining a set of physically-based process models and a methodology for partitioning and parameterizing the landscape, RHESSys is capable of modelling the spatial distribution and spatio-temporal interactions between different processes at the watershed scale</span></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<h2><span>What can you do with RHESSys Workflows? </span></h2>\n<p><span>RHESSysWorkflows provides Python scripts for building RHESSys models. These tools build on the workflow system defined by</span><a href=\"https://github.com/selimnairb/EcohydroLib\"> <span>EcohydroLib</span></a><span>. EcohydroLib provides a series of Python scripts for performing ecohydrology data preparation workflows. Workflow sub-components are orchestrated via a metadata persistence store provided by the ecohydrolib.metadata package. These scripts are built on top of a series of task-oriented APIs defined in the Python package EcohydroLib. The workflow scripts provide tools for downloading and manipulating geospatial data needed to run a ecohydrology models, information such as: digital elevation model (DEM), soils, land cover, and vegetation leaf area index. These data can be drawn both from national spatial data infrastructure (NLCD, SSURGO) as well as custom local datasets.</span></p>\n<p><span>A metadata store is used to orchestrate a series of workflow scripts used to prepare data for an ecohydrology model. The current implementation uses the Python ConfigParser key-value storage mechanism to persist metadata to disk, however conceivably any key-value store could be used. The metadata contains information related to the study area (e.g. bounding box, spatial reference, DEM resolution), as well as provenance information for each spatial data layer imported, and a processing history that records the parameters used to invoke each workflow script; provenance information is represented as a subset of Dublin Core attributes (</span><a href=\"http://dublincore.org\"><span>http://dublincore.org</span></a><span>). When using the workflow scripts in a stand-alone environment, the metadata store provides information necessary to understand where ecohydrology input data came from, and what transformations have been made to the data. When the workflow scripts are integrated into a data grid or workflow environment (e.g. iRODS), the metadata store can serve as a staging area for metadata and provenance information that will be registered into the formal workflow environment.</span></p>\n<p><span>The fundamental operation for any ecohydrology modeling workflow is to define the study region of interest (ROI). In EcohydroLib the ROI is simply defined as a bounding box of WGS84 latitude and longitude coordinates (e.g. coordinates for the upper- left and lower-right corners). For workflows using the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), the ROI bounding box can be derived using catchment polygons associated with the stream reaches upstream of a particular gage. The user begins by picking a streamflow discharge gage listed in the NHD dataset. EcohydroLib can then determine the stream reaches upstream of the data, and then select the catchment polygons associated with each upstream reach. From these polygons, the bounding box of the land area draining through the streamflow gage can easily be calculated.</span></p>\n<p><span>Once the ROI is known, EcohydroLib can extract datasets (DEM, soils, etc.) specific to the study area. Some of these datasets are extracted from static local copies of national spatial data (e.g. NLCD), while other are retrieved via web services interfaces from federal agency data centers (e.g. SSURGO soils data from USDA) or from third-party data centers (GeoBrain's DEM Explorer). However it is also possible for the user to register their own custom data for a given datatype (e.g. local LIDAR-based DEM).</span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"651\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/RheesysWorkflow/image00.png\" width=\"556\"></p>\n<h2><span>Model Output</span></h2>\n<p><span>RHESSys has more than 100 state variables that can be looked at. Different output options and different printing time scales produce output associated with different variables. RHESSys is a process-based spatially explicit model of coupled terrestrial hydrologic and biogeochemical cycling processes. Key hydrologic processes represented in the model include snow accumulation and melt, interception, infiltration, transpiration, soil and litter interception evaporation, vertical drainage, shallow and deep groundwater subsurface lateral flow. In the model, energy, moisture, nitrogen and carbon are conserved and energy, wind and water are attenuated through multiple canopy layers. Modeling of carbon cycling dynamics include estimation of canopy photosynthesis and respiration, the allocation of net photosynthesis to\u00a0</span><span>leaves, stem and roots, plant turnover and litter and soil decomposition and respiration. Plant nitrogen cycling in is generally stoichiometrically tied to carbon cycling. Microbial nitrogen processes include decomposition, nitrification and denitrification as well as nitrate export. All processes are modeled over-spatially complex terrain to account for variation in meteorologic forcing conditions, radiation and other inputs. Both water and nitrogen are explicitly routed between spatial patches, contributing to spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture and nitrogen availability and ultimately water and nitrogen fluxes to the stream. RHESSys uses a hierarchical spatial framework that allows different processes to be modeled at their most representative scale. Patches are the smallest horizontal spatial unit and are typically 10-30m grid cells but spatially variable, irregularly shaped patches are supported. Within patches, vertical modeling units are included to represent multiple canopy layers (overstory/understory and mixed canopies). Most processes are run at a daily time step.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Access the Model </span></h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Link to App page</span></li>\n<li><span>Link to external website </span></li>\n<li><span>Link to resources for Launching jupyter notebook</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>Computational resources required. \u00a0Platforms, code base, etc. </span></p>\n<p><i><span>RHESSysWorkflows: Python scripts for building RHESSys models.</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>GRASS</span></i><span>: \u00a0A free UNIX-based GIS software (</span><a href=\"http://grass.fbk.eu/\"><span>http://grass.fbk.eu/</span></a><span>)</span></p>\n<p><i><span>GRASS2WORLD</span></i><span> (</span><i><span>g2w</span></i><span>): \u00a0A program to generate a worldfile from spatial data layers within GRASS GIS</span></p>\n<p><span>AverageTables (</span><i><span>rat</span></i><span>): Necessary to simulate </span><i><span>g2w</span></i></p>\n<p><i><span>CREATEFLOWPATH</span></i><span> (</span><i><span>cf</span></i><span>): A program to generate a flowtable which describes connectivity between patches within a hillslope.

A group is a collection of Hydroshare users with a common resource landing page, that is populated by the resources owned and shared by the users in the group. A major part of this functionality includes Groups. You can create a Group for your research team and share resources within that group. Groups can be public or private, and you have control over what is shared with the group and what access group members have to the resources you share.

These elements follow the </span><a href=\"http://dublincore.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Dublin Core Metadata Initiative</span></a><span>\u2019s standard metadata terms, including title, abstract, subject keywords, spatial and temporal coverage. HydroShare users should treat datasets and models as first class research products - like the papers that are written about them. There is an opportunity to maximize the value of these research products by practicing good data management and creating descriptive metadata that allows others to easily understand and reuse your research datasets. The information below provides some best practices to keep in mind while describing your resource with metadata. For more detailed best practices, refer to the </span><a href=\"https://help.hydroshare.orghttps://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/hydroshare_guide_for_data_authors_and_publishers.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><span>HydroShare Guide for Data Authors and Publishers.</span></a></p>\n<h3><span>Abstract</span></h3>\n<p><span>The Abstract should put the content of the resource in context, including the rationale for the data collection or modeling and should be a specific description of the content files included in the resource. Ensure that the results described in the Abstract correspond to the files contained in the resource. The Abstract should include a description of the resource content and organization to help a potential user navigate the various files included. Where the content and organization of a resource is complicated, the Abstract may reference a README file included as a content file in the resource that provides a more detailed description of the resource\u2019s content files. If text is used from the Abstract of a journal article related to the resource, you should add additional details focused on describing the actual content of the resource.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Keywords</span></h3>\n<p><span>Keywords facilitate data discovery and should be selected to be descriptive and thorough for the associated data. Consider what the data represent, the variables included in the dataset, how the data were generated, and the geographic area that they represent. Unique acronym-like keywords may also be used similar to the way hashtags are used in some social media. For example, the term \u201ciUTAH\u201d is unique to a specific Utah research project named \u201ciUTAH.\u201d Use of this as a keyword facilitates discovery of resources associated with the iUTAH project.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>A resource must have at least one keyword to be made discoverable or public, but we encourage you to add multiple keywords to increase the discoverability of your resource. Keywords save automatically when you click \u201cadd\u201d.\u00a0</span></p>\n<h3><span>Files</span></h3>\n<p><span>File names should be descriptive and meaningful. Where many files are included in a resource, a README file that describes the content and/or organization of each file or the resource as a whole can be very useful in helping others understand the content of the resource.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Spatial and Temporal Coverage</span></h3>\n<p><span>These are optional metadata and should be used if the data or model in the resource has a geospatial \u201cfootprint\u201d or location or a temporal component/time window. Including appropriate spatial and temporal coverage metadata can help others discover your data if they are searching within a specific geographic location or over a specific time period.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Define all Terms</span></h3>\n<p><span>All abbreviations need to be defined somewhere within the resource. Even seemingly obvious cases should be spelled out (e.g., C=Carbon, N=Nitrogen). Unit symbols and abbreviations should also be defined (e.g., mg/L=milligrams per liter). Definitions should be handled wherever sub-file metadata is contained (e.g, in the resource Abstract, in a README file, or in file headers).</span></p>\n<p><br><br></p>"

You can keep your resources private, you can share your resources publicly for anyone to access, or you can share with individual HydroShare users or user groups. When you have finished your work and you are ready to formally publish your resource, HydroShare enables you to do so and will register a formal, citable digital object identifier (DOI) for your resource.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In HydroShare, the following definitions apply to the \"sharing status\" of a resource:</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Public</strong></span> - A \"public\" resource can be discovered by anyone, and anyone can access the files. The resource may not be final, may be subject to change, could be deleted, and is not considered to be published.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Discoverable</strong><strong></strong></span>- A \"discoverable\" resource can be discovered by a<span style=\"text-align: start; display: inline !important; float: none;\">nyone in HydroShare, but only users with permission can access the content files.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Published</strong></span> - A \"published\" resource is one that is finished and is formally published. Published resources receive formal DOIs and, when published users can no longer modify their content or metadata descriptions. Published resources can be discovered and accessed by the public.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Private</strong></span>- A \"private\" resource cannot be discovered by anyone except the user who created it.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Similar to the above definitions, there is a difference between \"sharing\" a resource and \"publishing\" a resource in HydroShare:</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Share</strong></span>: The act of giving another HydroShare user, user group, or the public the right to access the content and metadata description of a resource. \"Shared\" resources may still be private when shared only with individual users or groups.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Publish</strong></span>: The act of formally publishing a resource, which is very much like publishing a research paper. Once published, the resource can no longer be changed and has a permanent, citable DOI. Publishing a resource makes it accessible to the public.</p>\n<p>The following topics are available to assist you with sharing and publishing your resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/sharing-and-privacy/sharing-and-publishing-resources/\" target=\"_blank\">How can I make a resource public for anyone to access?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/sharing-and-privacy/sharing-resources-with-a-user-or-group/\" target=\"_blank\">How do I share with individual HydroShare users or user groups?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.hydroshare.org/creating-and-managing-resources/formally-publishing-data/ \" target=\"_blank\">How can I formally publish a resource and receive a DOI?</a></li>\n</ul>"

Doing so permits the resource to be cited in the paper, verified and examined by reviewers, and edited based on reviewer comments. When the paper is accepted for publication, the resource can then be permanently published with a citable Digital Object Identifier (DOI). Below are steps to accomplish this. Order may change slightly based on the journal.\u00a0</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>Create the resource in HydroShare, upload content files, and ensure that metadata are complete.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>Make the resource public.</span></li>\n<li><span>Cite the HydroShare resource in the references section of the paper using the HydroShare URL. This ensures that reviewers can access the resource.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>Submit the paper for review.</span></li>\n<li><span>Based on reviewer suggestions and paper revisions, make any changes that are necessary to the HydroShare resource.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>When the paper is accepted, in the final text submitted for typesetting, cite the HydroShare resource using its DOI reference. Use the prefix \u201c</span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4311/hs\"><span>https://doi.org/10.4211/hs</span></a><span>\u201d followed by the resource\u2019s unique identifier, which is indicated on the resource landing page \u201cHow to cite\u201d section.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>When the publisher issues a DOI for the paper, add the full reference for the paper to the related resources metadata on the HydroShare resource. This ensures that the HydroShare resource has a link that points at the final paper.\u00a0</span></li>\n<li><span>Then, finalize and permanently publish the HydroShare resource.\u00a0</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>If you follow this process, you will have a citation to the paper in your HydroShare resource that uses a DOI and a citation to the HydroShare resource in the paper that also uses a DOI.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"

This Users Area is especially well suited for handling large files (i.e., &gt; 1GB), that are often too large for http protocols. Using iRODS allows HydroShare to handle large files that otherwise would be impractical or impossible to handle via a web http interface. Herein it is documented how to access the HydroShare iRODS Users Area with a third-party Windows and Mac application called CyberDuck. CyberDuck is a free open source application that supports many transfer protocols (e.g. FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Azure, Amazon S3, etc.). As of version 4.7.1 and later, CyberDuck also supports the iRODS protocol. The iRODS protocol support within CyberDuck, when configured properly, is optimized for working with large files more efficiently than the http protocol alone.</span></p>\n<p><span>Following are the steps to install and configure CyberDuck for use with the HydroShare iRODS Users area. Note that both the profile and the software must first be downloaded separately before they can be run. You must have an existing HydroShare account and HydroShare iRODS Users Area account before proceeding (see </span><a href=\"https://help.hydroshare.org/creating-and-managing-resources/uploading-large-files-into-hydroshare/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>here</span></a><span> for setting up a iRODs account).</span></p>\n<p><b>Step One: Download the CyberDuck Profile for the HydroShare iRODS Users Area</b></p>\n<p><span>Download the file HydroShareUsers.cyberduckprofile from this </span><a href=\"https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/87f5341f93b944a7bb6e21c0745cb167/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>HydroShare resource</span></a><span> and place it on your desktop (but don't run it yet!).</span></p>\n<p><img alt='A resource called \"HydroShare iRODS users datagrid Cyberduck profile set\".

For example, you may want to record a relationship between the dataset you have created in HydroShare and a journal paper that uses or cites that dataset. Each relationship is a text field that may hold a link (expressed as a URL) or full reference information for related content. Where possible, the relationship field should not be limited to only a URL, but should hold the full bibliographic information for the referenced content. HydroShare also allows you to specify the type of relationship you want to store. The following relationship types are supported:</span></p>\n<p><b>The content of this resource was copied from</b><span>: If your HydroShare resource is a copy of another HydroShare resource or of content that is hosted or exists somewhere else, you can use this relationship type to refer to the location from which the content in your HydroShare resource was copied.</span></p>\n<p><b>The content of this resource is part of</b><span>: Use this relationship type to refer to another resource that your\u00a0 resource is part of. \u201cPart of\u201d relationships are automatically created when a resource is added to a HydroShare collection resource.</span></p>\n<p><b>The content of this resource can be executed by</b><span>: Use this to refer to a resource that may execute the current resource, such as the model program associated with a model instance.

For example, you might want to store a relationship with a paper, news item on the Internet, or other media type that describes the content of a particular resource.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Examples</span></h2>\n<h3><span>Linking your resource with a publication</span></h3>\n<p><span>Relationships provide a way to associate a HydroShare resource with a publication.\u00a0 Data published in HydroShare and used in a paper should be cited in the paper\u2019s reference list using the full HydroShare citation, including DOI, for the published resource (see \u201cHow to Cite\u201d on the resource\u2019s landing page in HydroShare).\u00a0 For example:</span></p>\n<p><span>Tarboton, D. (2017). Logan Specific Catchment Area, HydroShare,</span>\u00a0<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.4211/hs.877bf9ed9e66468cadddb229838a9ced\" target=\"_blank\">http://dx.doi.org/10.4211/hs.877bf9ed9e66468cadddb229838a9ced</a></p>\n<p><span>The HydroShare resource should then refer back to the paper using an appropriate relationship type (e.g., \u201c</span><span>The content of this resource is data for\u201d or \u201cThis resource is described by\u201d).</span><span> For example:</span></p>\n<p><img><img alt=\"\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/references_1.png\" width=\"624\"></p>\n<p><span>The relationship type to use depends on whether the paper serves to describe the data (use \u201cThis resource is described by\u201d), or just use the data held in the resource (use \u201cThe content of this resource serves as the data for\u201d).</span></p>\n<h3><span>If the Journal Publication is Not Yet Accepted</span></h3>\n<p><span>It is important to realize that you cannot edit the authorship, title, or content files of a HydroShare resource once it is formally published and receives a DOI. However, you can add relationship metadata to published resources if needed (e.g., adding a reference to a related paper if the paper is published after the resource is published).\u00a0 If you are certain that the data/content in your resource is complete, finished, and will not change, you can formally publish your resource prior to submitting your related paper for publication and cite it using the resource\u2019s DOI in the References section of your paper. Once the related paper is published, you can then edit the resource and add a reference to the paper to the published resource\u2019s metadata.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, if you anticipate that the content of your resource might change based on feedback from the reviewers of your paper, you may choose to leave the HydroShare resource public but unpublished during your paper\u2019s review process. In the paper, you would cite the resource as follows:</span></p>\n<p><span>Author\u2019s last name(s), year. Title of Hydroshare Resource, HydroShare. Unpublished Resource URL.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>For example, this resource: <a href=\"https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/877bf9ed9e66468cadddb229838a9ced/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/877bf9ed9e66468cadddb229838a9ced/</a> would have the following citation in the journal paper submitted for review:</span></p>\n<p><span>Tarboton, D., 2015.

(2017). Logan Specific Catchment Area, HydroShare, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.4211/hs.877bf9ed9e66468cadddb229838a9ced\" target=\"_blank\">http://dx.doi.org/10.4211/hs.877bf9ed9e66468cadddb229838a9ced</a>.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><span>Note that HydroShare uses the following pattern when creating DOIs:</span></p>\n<p><span>\u201c10.4211/hs.&lt;HydroShare_internal_identifier&gt;\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span>The DOI uses \u201c10.4211/hs.\u201d followed by HydroShare\u2019s internal identifier for your resource, which is created when you first create your resource in HydroShare. You can anticipate this pattern for the DOI of your published HydroShare Resource, even before it is formally published in HydroShare. However the URL of the resource containing the DOI (e.g., </span><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.4211/hs.877bf9ed9e66468cadddb229838a9ced\"><span>http://dx.doi.org/10.4211/hs.877bf9ed9e66468cadddb229838a9ced</span></a><span>) will not work until your resource has been formally published.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>When finalizing a paper for publication, you should first ensure that your resource is published and has been issued a DOI. You should then change the reference to your HydroShare resource in the paper to use the URL that contains the DOI.\u00a0 As soon as the published paper has been assigned a DOI, you should then edit the HydroShare resource to add a relationship with the full bibliographic citation that points to the paper.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>Note that upon submission of a resource for formal publication in HydroShare, it will be checked for completeness by CUAHSI during the DOI registration process.</span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3><span>If the resource components are copied from an external source</span></h3>\n<p><span>Sometimes a user would like to archive a specific version of a resource that is published by an external source so he or she can link it with other resources in the HydroShare system. This is a common use case, especially for a model program as users may want to archive a frozen copy of a specific model version that is officially published by the model provider, in the HydroShare system. This way it can be used with model instances in HydroShare to guarantee the reproducibility of the same model instance resource output. For example, the EPA-SWMM model version 5.1.010 is used to execute a specific model instance use case that is</span><a href=\"https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/12d195906f2c41918cb24e11a5c3ab60/\" target=\"_blank\"> <span>archived through HydroShare</span></a><span>. Therefore, there is a need to preserve a copy of this specific model version in HydroShare to guarantee the reproducibility of the same model instance output. A copy of this model was archived in the HydroShare system and the \u201cisCopiedFrom\u201d relation is used to record and give credit to the model website as a primary source. By using this relationship, the following citation was generated automatically by the HydroShare system:</span></p>\n<p><span>Rossman, L., T. Schade, D. Sullivan, R. Dickinson, C. Chan, E. Burgess (2017). Storm Water Management Model (SWMM),</span><a href=\"http://www2.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm\" target=\"_blank\"> <span>http://www2.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm</span></a><span>, accessed 6/30/2017, replicated in HydroShare at:</span><a href=\"http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/2cddae40e9594c21b947fdbbe4225439\" target=\"_blank\"> <span>http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/2cddae40e9594c21b947fdbbe4225439</span></a></p>\n<p><br><img height=\"83\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/how_to_cite.png\" width=\"750\"></p>\n<h3><span>Relationships with Model resources</span></h3>\n<p><span><strong>Important note:</strong> The Model Instance and Model Program resources are no more supported in HydroShare; instead they are superseded by Model Instance and Model Program aggregations. The content of this section will undergo some necessary edits soon to reflect the aforementioned change but the resources mentioned below are still accessible.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span>There are several relationships that can be used with the model resource types in HydroShare. For example, a model instance resource can be related to the specific resource that executes it using the \u201cExecutedBy\u201d relation. This model instance resource that includes the post-processed input data can be also be related to the resource containing the raw data in the HydroShare system using the \u201cDerivedFrom\u201d relation. This model instance can be combined with other resources in a collection resources type. The \u201cIsPartOf\u201d relation can be used to indicate the collection resource that the model instance resource is a part of. For example, the \u201c</span><a href=\"https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/19605cf6e91e415fb98b7a28cad263d6/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>ModflowNwtSciunitOutput</span></a><span>\u201d MODFLOW model instance resource is derived from (\u201cDerivedFrom\u201d relation) a generic model instance resource, \u201c</span><a href=\"https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/4c9f9daa09e745a5b285481c7903c759/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>ModflowNwtRawData</span></a><span>\u201d, that includes the raw data. It is executed by (\u201cIsExecutedBy\u201d relation) a resource, \u201c</span><a href=\"https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/995479b35b62486783e0da63e937ca89/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>ModflowNwtSciunit</span></a><span>\u201d, and is a part of (\u201cIsPartOf\u201d relation) a collection resource, \u201c</span><a href=\"https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/bf598099ed384540aaa9284b7343a717/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>ModflowNwtCollection</span></a><span>.\u201d When a resource is made a part of a collection resource, that relationship is indicated on the resource\u2019s landing page with the text: \u201cThis resource belongs to the following collections:\u201d (see screenshot below).</span></p>\n<p><img height=\"146\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/relation2.png\" width=\"750\"></p>\n<p></p>"

These elements follow the </span><a href=\"http://dublincore.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Dublin Core Metadata Initiative</a><span>\u2019s standard metadata terms, including title, abstract, subject keywords, spatial and temporal coverage, etc. HydroShare users should treat datasets and models as first class research products - along with the papers that are written about them.\u00a0There is opportunity to maximize the value of these research products by practicing good data management and creating descriptive metadata. The information below provides some best practices to keep in mind while describing your resource with metadata. For more detailed best practices, refer to the <a href=\"https://help.hydroshare.orghttps://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/hydroshare_guide_for_data_authors_and_publishers.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">HydroShare Guide for Data Authors and Publishers.</a></span></p>\n<h3>Abstract</h3>\n<p>The Abstract should put the content of the resource in context, including the rationale for the data collection or modeling and should be a specific description of the content files included in the resource. Ensure that the results described in the Abstract correspond to the files contained in the resource. The Abstract should include a description of the resource content and organization to help a potential user navigate the various files included. Where the content and organization of a resource is complicated, the Abstract may reference a README file included as a content file in the resource that provides a more detailed description of the resource\u2019s content files. Additional details may be added to the Abstract to describe the methods of data creation - i.e., what you did, why you did it, how you did it, when and where you did it, etc. If text is used from the Abstract of a journal article related to the resource, add additional details focused on describing the actual content of the resource.</p>\n<h3>Keywords</h3>\n<p>Keywords facilitate data discovery and should be selected to be descriptive and thorough for the associated data. Consider what the data represent, the variables included in the dataset, how the data were generated, and the geographic area that they represent. Unique acronym-like keywords may also be used similar to the way hashtags are used in some social media. For example, the term \u201ciUTAH\u201d is unique to a specific Utah research project named \u201ciUTAH.\u201d Use of this as a keyword facilitates discovery of resources associated with the iUTAH project.\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Files</h3>\n<p>File names should be descriptive and meaningful. Where many files are included in a resource, a README file that describes the content and/or organization of each file or the resource as a whole can be very useful in helping others understand the content of the resource.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Spatial and Temporal Coverage</h3>\n<p>These are optional metadata and should be used if the data or model in the resource has a geospatial \u201cfootprint\u201d or location or a temporal component/time window. Including appropriate spatial and temporal coverage metadata can help others discover your data if they are searching within a specific geographic location or over a specific time period.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">\u00a0Other Details</h3>\n<p>All abbreviations need to be defined somewhere within the resource. Even seemingly obvious cases should be spelled out (e.g., C=Carbon, N=Nitrogen). Unit symbols and abbreviations should also be defined (e.g., mg/L=milligrams per liter). Definitions should be handled wherever sub-file metadata is contained (e.g, in the resource Abstract, in a README file, or in file headers).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>"

Then choose \u201cCreate your iRODS user account\u201d on the left underneath your HydroShare user profile picture to create your corresponding HydroShare iRODS User account.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><img alt='The profile image icon ( a head shape in a circle), and below are the linked text options \"Change Password\", \"Deactivate Account\", and \"Create your iRODS user account\"' height=\"320\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/lf_pic_03.png\" width=\"228\"></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Step Two. Use a 3rd-party iRODS Client Like CyberDuck To Access Your HydroShare iRDOS User Account</b></p>\n<p><span>There are separate instructions for how to use a 3rd-party iRODS client like CyberDuck to access your HydroShare iRODS User Area found </span><a href=\"https://help.hydroshare.org/creating-and-managing-resources/accessing-irods-from-a-windowmac/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Follow these instructions and/or use the iRODS client of your preference and upload your arbitrarily large file(s), and/or any size files, into your HydroShare iRODS User Account area.</span></p>\n<p><b>Step Three: Create A New Resource Within HydroShare, And Load Files From Your HydroShare iRODS User Area</b></p>\n<p><span>You can load big files from your HydroShare iRODS User Area into a new or existing HydroShare resource by navigating to the landing page of the resource. To create a new resource, log into HydroShare, and click on \u201cCreate\u201d to the left of your profile photo on the top right of the home page.\u00a0 On the resource landing page, click on the pencil edit icon on the top right for edit mode, then scroll down to the file browser area. Click on \u2018iRODS\u201d drop down list, and select \u201cLog in to iRODS\u201d to bring up the dialog as shown below. In addition to entering your credentials, enter \u201cusers.hydroshare.org\u201d for the \u201cHost:\u201d, \u201c1247\u201d for the \u201cPort:\u201d, and \u201chydroshareuserZone\u201d for the \u201cZone:\u201d</span></p>\n<p><img alt='a box with the heading \"Log into an iRODS server\". The box contains the subfields with text entry boxes \"iRODS username\", \"iRODS Password\", \"Host\", \"Port\", and \"Zone\". There are two buttons at the bottom, \"Close\" and \"sign in\"' height=\"408\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/irods_login.jpg\" width=\"406\"></p>\n<p><span>Once your login to HydroShare iRODS User Area is successful, select \u201cAdd files from iRODS\u201d as shown below and select the files you wish to add to the HydroShare Resource. When confirmed, the files selected from iRODS should be added to this resource.</span></p>\n<p><img alt='a pop up box with two buttons at the top \"Add files\" and \"iRODS: username\". The dropdown menu is open beneath the iRods button, with two options: \"Add files from iRods\" and \"Log out of iRODS\". ' height=\"178\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/unnamed.jpg\" width=\"258\"></p>\n<p><b>Success</b></p>\n<p><span>You have now successfully ingested a file into HydroShare with iRODS. If you would like to access additional helpful information about iRODS, please see </span><a href=\"http://irods.org/about/overview/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><b>Notes</b></p>\n<p><span>These instructions also work for ingesting any size files (i.e. small or large) from your HydroShare iRODS User Area into HydroShare.</span></p>"

      "content": "<p>HydroShare provides a standard set of metadata elements for describing the resources that you create. These elements follow the <a href=\"http://dublincore.org/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Dublin Core Metadata Initiative</a>\u2019s standard metadata terms, including title, abstract, subject keywords, spatial and temporal coverage, etc. For best practices on what to include in your metadata, check out:<a href=\"https://help.hydroshare.org/creating-and-managing-resources/best-practices-for-describing-your-resource-with-metadata/\" target=\"_blank\"> Following Metadata Best Practices</a>.\u00a0When you create a new resource, you will be taken to the landing page for that resource, where you can edit the metadata. You can also edit the metadata elements of your resource at any point after its creation by clicking on the \u201cEdit Resource\u201d button on the landing page.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/metadata1.png\" width=\"511\"></p>\n<p><strong>Editing Standard Metadata Elements</strong></p>\n<p>Once in edit mode, many of the metadata elements can be edited directly on the page. For example, click in the Abstract field, add descriptive text, and remember to Save Changes. Subject keywords can be added by typing keywords in the text box and clicking the \u201cAdd\u201d button.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<img alt=\"\" height=\"229\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/image_2-8-19_at_2.49_pm.jpg\" width=\"660\"></p>\n<p><strong>Spatial and Temporal Coverage</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The spatial and temporal coverage metadata can be set in multiple ways. You can type in coordinates or dates into the text boxes. For spatial coverage you can click a point or draw a box on the corresponding map. You can also click the buttons to set the spatial and/or temporal coverage from the content files in your resource. When you click these buttons, HydroShare will query the metadata for your content files and will return a point or bounding box and date range that contain all of the data you have added to your resource.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"504\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/image_2-8-19_at_2.50_pm.jpg\" width=\"610\"></p>\n<p><strong>Additional Metadata</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>You can describe your resource using additional metadata elements beyond those Dublin Core elements provided directly on the page. If you click the plus button to add an additional metadata element, you can name that element whatever you want. For example, in the figure below, a new metadata element called \u201cMeasured Variables\u201d will be created with a value of \u201cWater temperature.\u201d You can use the Additional Metadata section to create whatever metadata elements you need to describe your data.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<img alt=\"\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/metadata4.png\" width=\"394\"></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>README Functionality</strong></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you may wish to add a detailed description of the contents of your resource, and it is inconvenient to type all of this text into the Abstract element or to include it as \u201cAdditional Metadata\u201d elements. In this case, you can upload a detailed README file to your resource. The content of the README file is up to you, but generally, README files are useful to encode detailed text that describes the nature and content of your resource. This may include a detailed description of a study site, methods, observed or simulated variables, the structure and content of the folders within a resource and the data files themselves, etc.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>If you upload a README file to the root folder (i.e., the top level folder of your resource), HydroShare will display the content of your README file on the landing page for your resource just below the file content area. README files must be text files with a \u201c.txt\u201d or \u201c.md\u201d file extension to be displayed on the page. If you use a \u201c.md\u201d file extension for your README file, you can use Markdown formatting in your README file and HydroShare will render your rich formatted text on the landing page. For a simple reference on how to use Markdown formatting see <span><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax\" target=\"_blank\">https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax</a></span>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0<img alt=\"\" height=\"505\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/hydroshare-help-pages-media/uploads/image_2-8-19_at_2.52_pm.jpg\" width=\"561\"></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>"
